Scraped from my old files

**Note:** This repository serves as a reminder from my past self, highlighting the mistakes and shortcomings I made during my early days in college, It was originally created with the primary goal of passing a semester. As I revisit this project, I've identified several shortcomings and bad practices that I want to acknowledge:

1. **Lack of MySQL Parameters:** I did not use MySQL parameters to prevent SQL injections, which is a significant security concern.

2. **Violation of DRY Principle:** The code lacks adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. There is redundant code that could be refactored for better maintainability.

3. **No Password Hashing:** Security is compromised as passwords are stored in plain text, without proper hashing.

4. **Improper Input Sanitization:** Input data is not adequately sanitized, leaving the application vulnerable to various security threats.

5. **Excessive Use of Divs:** The project includes an overuse of div elements, indicating a lack of structuring and design considerations.

and many more. You can look at it by yourself.

This README is a testament to my ongoing learning journey. It symbolizes the mistakes made and the commitment to continuous improvement in coding practices.
